After road element extraction, to both "+ "discard redundant segments and avoid gaps, a special "+ "perceptual grouping algorithm is devised, exploiting "+ "colinearity as well as proximity concepts. Finally, the road "+ "network topology is considered, checking for road "+ "intersections and regularizing the overall patterns using "+ "these focal points. The proposed procedure was tested on a "+ "pair of very high resolution images, one from an optical "+ "sensor and one from a SAR sensor. The experiments show an "+ "increase in both the completeness and the quality indexes "+ "for the extracted road network.",(String)a.getField("abstract"));
