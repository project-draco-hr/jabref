  entry.setField("abstract","Abstract The present paper studied the influence of different food regimes " + "on the free amino acid (FAA) pool, the rate of protein turnover, the flux of amino acids, and " + "their relation to growth of larval turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.) from first feeding until "+ "metamorphosis. The amino acid profile of protein was stable during the larval period although "+ "some small, but significant, differences were found. Turbot larvae had proteins which were rich "+ "in leucine and aspartate, and poor in glutamate, suggesting a high leucine requirement. The "+ "profile of the FAA pool was highly variable and quite different from the amino acid profile in "+ "protein. The proportion of essential FAA decreased with development. High contents of free tyrosine "+ "and phenylalanine were found on Day 3, while free taurine was present at high levels throughout "+ "the experimental period. Larval growth rates were positively correlated with taurine levels, "+ "suggesting a dietary dependency for taurine and/or sulphur amino acids.\n\nReduced growth rates in "+ "Artemia-fed larvae were associated with lower levels of free methionine, indicating that this diet "+ "is deficient in methionine for turbot larvae. Leucine might also be limiting turbot growth as the "+ "different diet organisms had lower levels of this amino acid in the free pool than was found in the "+ "larval protein. A previously presented model was used to describe the flux of amino acids in growing "+ "turbot larvae. The FAA pool was found to be small and variable. It was estimated that the daily dietary "+ "amino acid intake might be up to ten times the larval FAA pool. In addition, protein synthesis and "+ "protein degradation might daily remove and return, respectively, the equivalent of up to 20 and 10 "+ "times the size of the FAA pool. In an early phase (Day 11) high growth rates were associated with a "+ "relatively low protein turnover, while at a later stage (Day 17), a much higher turnover was observed.");
